Collage - Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli,"The user had a great experience at the restaurant, but was disappointed with their team lunch. They were offered only 2 types of starters and no mutton items in starters or main course. The service was poor and slow, and they felt that none of the staff was nice or responsive to make them feel good. However, they enjoyed the waffle cart for breakfast and liked the variety of options on the menu. They also appreciated the fruit selection and added some fresh juices. Overall, they found the atmosphere peaceful and enjoyable during late nights.",
Deli 9 Bistro,"The user had a great experience at Deli 9 Bistro, with an interesting atmosphere and delicious food. They ordered Alfredo Pasta and Chicken Sizzler, but felt the fish was hard and the vegetables needed salt. Overall, they were a fan of their food and drinks, but found the prices to be on the higher side. They also enjoyed nachos and tenderloin burgers. The service was quick and polite, but the vegetarian menu is limited.","The atmosphere is marvelous and the food was amazing. We ordered a bull frog, fanta, pepper chicken bao, fish and chips, Cajun chicken breast sizzler, and Alfredo Pasta with no spice. Our server was rude but our soups and desserts were delicious. Overall, we had a good experience at Deli 9 Bistro and recommend their menu to others."
